# Blinky Mbed OS example

The example project is part of the [Arm Mbed OS Official Examples](https://os.mbed.com/code/) and is the [getting started example for Mbed OS](https://os.mbed.com/docs/mbed-os/v5.14/quick-start/index.html). It contains an application that repeatedly blinks an LED on supported [Mbed boards](https://os.mbed.com/platforms/).

You can build the project with all supported [Mbed OS build tools](https://os.mbed.com/docs/mbed-os/latest/tools/index.html). However, this example project specifically refers to the command-line interface tool [Arm Mbed CLI](https://github.com/ARMmbed/mbed-cli#installing-mbed-cli).
(Note: To see a rendered example you can import into the Arm Online Compiler, please see our [import quick start](https://os.mbed.com/docs/mbed-os/latest/quick-start/online-with-the-online-compiler.html#importing-the-code).)

1. [Install Mbed CLI](https://os.mbed.com/docs/mbed-os/latest/quick-start/offline-with-mbed-cli.html).

1. Clone this repository on your system, and change the current directory to where the project was cloned:

    ```bash
    $ git clone git@github.com:armmbed/mbed-os-example-blinky && cd mbed-os-example-blinky
    ```

    Alternatively, you can download the example project with Arm Mbed CLI using the `import` subcommand:

    ```bash
    $ mbed import mbed-os-example-blinky && cd mbed-os-example-blinky
    ```


## Application functionality

The `main()` function is the single thread in the application. It toggles the state of a digital output connected to an LED on the board.

## Building and running

1. Connect a USB cable between the USB port on the board and the host computer.
2. <a name="build_cmd"></a> Run the following command to build the example project and program the microcontroller flash memory:
    ```bash
    $ mbed compile -m <TARGET> -t <TOOLCHAIN> --flash
    ```
The binary is located at `./BUILD/<TARGET>/<TOOLCHAIN>/mbed-os-example-blinky.bin`.

Alternatively, you can manually copy the binary to the board, which you mount on the host computer over USB.

Depending on the target, you can build the example project with the `GCC_ARM`, `ARM` or `IAR` toolchain. After installing Arm Mbed CLI, run the command below to determine which toolchain supports your target:

```bash
$ mbed compile -S
```

## Expected output
The LED on your target turns on and off every 500 milliseconds.


## Troubleshooting
If you have problems, you can review the [documentation](https://os.mbed.com/docs/latest/tutorials/debugging.html) for suggestions on what could be wrong and how to fix it.

## Project Overview
This project implements two main functionalities using a **Nucleo board** with an **Arduino multifunction shield**:
1. **Real-Time Clock (RTC)** - Displays elapsed time in MM:SS format
2. **Analog Signal Display** - Shows potentiometer voltage when activated

## Features
- 4-digit 7-segment display output
- Reset functionality with button S1
- Voltage monitoring via onboard potentiometer
- Toggle between time/voltage display with button S3
- Automatic min/max voltage tracking

## Hardware Requirements
- STM32 Nucleo board (any model)
- Arduino multifunction shield with:
  - 4-digit 7-segment display
  - 3 push buttons
  - Potentiometer
- USB cable for programming/power

## Pin Connections
| Shield Component | Nucleo Pin |
|-----------------|-----------|
| Shift Register Data | D8 |
| Shift Register Clock | D7 |
| Shift Register Latch | D4 |
| Button S1 (Reset) | A1 |
| Button S3 (Voltage) | A3 |
| Potentiometer | A0 |

## Software Requirements
- Mbed Studio or Mbed CLI
- Mbed OS 6.x
- STM32 HAL libraries

## How It Works
1. **On Startup**:
   - Clock begins counting from 00:00
   - Min/max voltage tracking initialized

2. **Normal Operation**:
   - Display shows elapsed time (MM:SS)
   - Press S1 to reset clock to 00:00
   - Press and hold S3 to show current voltage (X.XXV)

3. **Background Processes**:
   - Timer interrupt updates time every second
   - ADC continuously samples potentiometer
   - Min/max voltage values are tracked
